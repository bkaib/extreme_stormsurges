# Estimating Extreme Storm Surges in the Baltic Sea via Machine Learning

# Short Description
The aim of this project is to estiamte extreme 
storm surges (>90%-percentiles) in the Baltic Sea via Machine Learning Algorithms like Random Forests, 
simple Neural Networks and Generative Adversarial Networks. 
We aim for not only a classification of storm surges but also a continous forecast of sea level height 
depending on several predictors for storm surges in the Baltic Sea.
The masterthesis is conducted together with the Helmholtz-Zentrum-Hereon and the University of Hamburg 
and is embedded in the CLimate INTelligence project.
